                Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
                The Federal Trade Commission, United States&#39; consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule,
                which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children&#39;s
                privacy and safety online.</p>
